This is basically just a minimalistic USB hub for the PB2 that I am implementing into a bigger project that I have made a REPO for. I have also included the Gerber and schematic so that you can rebuild or buy/sell/improve my design.


**Warning:**

This has not been tested yet, if you somehow manage to make this before I do please know that resisters R1, R2, and R3 do not have values because I have not calculated what they should be so please if you make this before me just leave them R1, 2, and 3 unpopulated, the only thing that will not work are the LEDs 

**Dimentions**

Width: 36.449 mm
Length: 18.542 mm
